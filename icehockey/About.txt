To apply the patch (easy):
	- Use LunarIPS to apply patch.ips to the NA ROM release of Ice Hockey. 
	- Other programs might work but haven't been tested.
	
To use ihsie to patch (more manual):

	Get your copy of the Ice Hockey ROM, called icehockey.nes.
	
	Run the following commands	
	
	copy /Y icehockey.nes icehockey.orig.nes
	(to create a backup in case something goes wrong)
	
	ihsie import icehockeysprites_8010.png icehockey.nes 0x8010
	ihsie import icehockeysprites_9010.png icehockey.nes 0x9010
